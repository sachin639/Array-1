Problem statement
You have been given an array/list(ARR) of size N. You need to swap every pair of alternate elements in the array/list.

You don't need to print or return anything, just change in the input array itself.

solution: 



public class Solution {
    
    public static void swapAlternate(int arr[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
        int temp;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length-1;i+=2){
            temp=arr[i];
            arr[i]=arr[i+1];
            arr[i+1]=temp;
        }
}
}
