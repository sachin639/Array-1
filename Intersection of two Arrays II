Problem statement
You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first array/list(ARR1)


Solution :




public class Solution{  
    
    public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
        for(int i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<arr2.length;j++){
                if(arr2[j]==arr1[i]){
                    System.out.print(arr1[i]+" ");
                    arr2[j]=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
