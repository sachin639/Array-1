You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.

Your task is to populate the array using the integer values in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,5,.......,6,4,2.

Sample Input 1 :
1
6
Sample Output 1 :
1 3 5 6 4 2
Explanation of Sample Input 1 :
Since the value of N is 6, the number will be stored in the array in such a fashion that 1 will appear at 0th index, then 2 at the last index, in a similar fashion 3 is stored at index 1. Hence the array becomes 1 3 5 6 4 2.\



Solution:

// import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void arrange(int[] arr, int n) {
    	//Your code goes here
        if(n==0){
             return;
        }
        int val =1;
        int end =n-1;
        for(int i=0;i<=(n-1)/2;i++){
            arr[i]=val;
            val+=2;
        }
        val=2;
        for(int i=end ;i>(n-1)/2;i--){
            arr[i]=val;
            val+=2;
        }           
    }
}
