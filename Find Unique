Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M + 1].

Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once.

You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.

 Note:
Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.


Sample Input 1:
1
7
2 3 1 6 3 6 2
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation: The array is [2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 6, 2]. Here, the numbers 2, 3, and 6 are present twice, and the number 1 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 1.


import java.util.*;
public class Solution{  

    public static int findUnique(int[] arr){
		//Your code goes here
    if(arr.length==1){
      return arr[0];
    }
    Arrays.sort(arr);
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i+=2){
      if(arr[i]!=arr[i+1]){
        return arr[i];
      }
    }
    return 0;
